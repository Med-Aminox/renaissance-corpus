[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §1]
I think that the aim of the perfect courtier is to become so accomplished that whatever he does or says appears effortless, and yet all is done with grace and judgment. This quality I call sprezzatura, a certain nonchalance that conceals all artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effortless.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §2]
The courtier must avoid affectation above all things, for affectation is the enemy of grace. He who strains too visibly after effect, who labors to display his learning or his wit, betrays the very qualities he seeks to demonstrate. True excellence reveals itself naturally, without ostentation.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §3]
It is necessary for the courtier to be a man of arms, for this was the principal profession of those who served princes in former times. Yet he must also cultivate letters, for the joining of arms and letters produces the most excellent type of man, each discipline perfecting the other.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §4]
True nobility proceeds not from blood but from virtue. The courtier must cultivate letters, arms, and moral character, so that he may serve both himself and the common good. Noble birth may open doors, but only virtue keeps them open.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §5]
The courtier should be naturally graceful in all bodily exercises, especially in arms. He should excel in riding, in handling every kind of weapon, in swimming, jumping, running, and casting stones. These physical accomplishments, when joined with mental cultivation, produce the complete man.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §6]
Music is not to be despised, for it softens the hardness of our souls and makes us more receptive to virtue. The courtier should be able to read music at sight, to play several instruments with skill, and to understand the theory that underlies the practice. Yet here too he must avoid ostentation.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §7]
To speak well and act rightly are inseparable, for eloquence without virtue is empty, and virtue without expression is mute. The courtier must therefore study rhetoric and philosophy, that he may give worthy form to worthy thought, and through his speech illuminate the path of right action.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §8]
In conversation, the courtier should adapt himself to the company he keeps, speaking of serious matters with the learned, of pleasant things with ladies, of military affairs with soldiers. This flexibility of discourse, far from being mere flattery, is a sign of true understanding and genuine courtesy.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §9]
The courtier must be careful in his jests and witticisms. Humor should never wound or humiliate, but should rather illuminate truth through clever observation. The best wit arises spontaneously from the occasion and never appears labored or premeditated.

[Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, Bk I §10]
Above all, the courtier must serve his prince with absolute loyalty and devotion. Yet this service should never become servility. He must speak truth to power when necessary, tempering honesty with discretion, and always preferring the good of the commonwealth to his own advancement.
