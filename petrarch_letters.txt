[Petrarch, Letters, L1]
I am not ashamed to confess that I love antiquity. I do not reject our own age, but I admire those ancient minds whose works shine with virtue and wisdom. From them I learn how to live, not how to argue endlessly. The moderns multiply words; the ancients cultivated deeds.

[Petrarch, Letters, L2]
What profit is there in subtle disputations that sharpen the tongue but leave the soul barren? True learning reforms the mind, disciplines the passions, and teaches us to live well. Philosophy should be a guide to virtue, not a playground for intellectual vanity.

[Petrarch, Letters, L3]
Books are my companions. Through them I converse with the greatest minds, not to display knowledge, but to cultivate judgment and character. In Cicero I find eloquence married to wisdom; in Virgil, the dignity of expression; in Seneca, moral fortitude. These are teachers who never weary, never flatter, never deceive.

[Petrarch, Letters, L4]
Solitude is not the enemy of learning but its friend. In quiet retreat, away from the tumult of cities and courts, the mind can contemplate truth without distraction. There I read, I write, I think—and in thinking, I become more fully human.

[Petrarch, Letters, L5]
The pursuit of fame is not ignoble if rightly understood. I seek not the applause of the multitude, but the approval of the wise and good. Let my works outlive me, not for my glory, but so that others may profit from whatever truth I have been able to grasp.

[Petrarch, Letters, L6]
We moderns are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants. We see farther than the ancients not because we are taller, but because we stand upon their shoulders. Yet many of us prefer to stand on the ground, where we see nothing at all.

[Petrarch, Letters, L7]
To read without reflection is to eat without digestion. I do not rush through books as some do, gathering facts like a miser hoards coins. Instead, I pause, I ponder, I let the wisdom of the ages penetrate my soul and reshape my understanding.

[Petrarch, Letters, L8]
Eloquence is the servant of wisdom, not its master. Those who cultivate words without cultivating thought are like farmers who tend their gates but neglect their fields. Yet wisdom without eloquence is like a lamp beneath a bushel—its light benefits no one.

[Petrarch, Letters, L9]
I love my country, but I love truth more. Patriotism should not blind us to our faults, nor should it make us enemies of other nations. The true citizen serves his homeland best by pursuing excellence and speaking truth, even when truth is unwelcome.

[Petrarch, Letters, L10]
The love of learning should never eclipse the love of virtue. Knowledge puffs up, as the Scripture says, but charity builds up. Let us study not to appear learned, but to become better—more just, more temperate, more wise in the conduct of life.
